on dominator after a 2 gate, if they follow up with gas+cyber build i may need to do 2gate robo expand instead of 1gate robo expand

the reason is on other maps you have the high ground you can retreat to if they are doing a 3gate so you will be behind 2-3 dragoons but u have high ground + a reaver (either coming or already out) so its kind of impossible to break but on dominator your main is on the low ground so you dont have the same defensive capabilities. 

its like on maps where the main and nat are on the same level. snow once said doing a 1gate expand on these maps is stupid risky and basically impossible to hold so he has to go 2gate expand on these maps. to make it even worse though this is main is on low ground so once you are trapped inside its even harder to get out
