### Game Build and Notes
![[Pasted image 20251214133427.png]]
- The following pylon position lets you get the high ground gateway and low ground cyber 
- @2:56 snow starts goon range but it is just a fake. He also gets range way later but because this game is a DT opener I think it is on purpose because the DT's will be in time to defend timing pushes
