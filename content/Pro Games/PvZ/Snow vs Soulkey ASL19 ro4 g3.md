Map: [[Dominator]]

Snow BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]
Soulkey BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]

### Game Build and Notes
- after the 5th probe mines one mineral patch send it across the map
- 8 - 0:49 - pylon (in the center)
- 9 - 1:14 - gate 1
- 9 - 1:28 - gate 2
- @100% gate 1  (and then 2) full pump zealots
- 15 - 2:16 - pylon
- 22 - 2:50 - pylon
- 29 - 3:35 - pylon

`note: it looks like the whole goal of snow with this rush is to kill the natural hatch. he isnt splitting off any zealots or anything he is keeping them all together and making sure he is engaging with a full straight line of zealots and performing moving shots. he is pulling back the low health ones when needed. soulkey brings some drones to build a spine and mineral walk to glitch out the zealots a bit. Just keep in mind snow is never greeding for the hatch, i think he could have and killed it but my guess is if he does and doesnt kill the zerglings then he will die to a simple counter attack? im not sure but hes hesitant to `

- 4:30 - gate (in main)

`note at this point soulkey got a spine up and snow has to transition and this prompted snow to build a gate in his main`

- 5:22 - pylon at natrual
- 6:14 - forge at nat

`note snow is doing a lot of dancing with soulkey because soulkey hasnt built any drones still so snow is constantly having to shift where is zealots are between defending the middle gates and defending his main`

`note: soulkey finishs speed now and so snow is forced to cannon in his main and bascially bring all his zealots back. before speed the zealots could sort of mirror how the zergligns move but now with speed its just impossible so hes just bringing all the zealots back `

- 7:45 - assimilator
- 8:00 - forge in main (cuz it was killed in nat by speedlings)
- 8:30 - 2 cannons at natural 

`note its about now when soulkey starts getting rid of the center gates cuz snow cant defend both his base and the gate as said earlier`

- 9:14 - nat nexus

`note: at this point snow is so ahead in just worker count alone hes going to slow it down and just build himself up. soulkey really wanted to end the game but he couldnt`

- 9:20 - cyber
- 10:05 - @100% cyber - stargate
- 10:20 - second cannon in main base

`note: snow gets the second cannon because I think he is unsure about soulkey's economic status, he is just preparing just in case`

- 11:00 - citadel 
- 11:00 - gas 2
- 12:05 - templar archives + gateway 2
- 12:30 - gate 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 and 9
- 14:40 - 3rd base

`note at this point its looking quite normal like hes got 9 gates, making HT + a couple DT, some corsair. I am sure hes also getting robo as well. I think snow has just slowed this game down a whole bunch because he is ahead and hes just covering all his bases and taking it slow`

`note: at 20min snow is on 5 bases and he is just walking back a forth, storming. he is doing this thing he says where your like storm grinding lol the only thing I am worried about is because snow has taken the game so slowly hes actually a bit behind in supply which means soulkeys army is huge which might cause problems`

`note: at this point the game becomes a really scrappy mess. soulkey ends up attacking with all of his stuff and like i said earlier it was A LOT and it felt like snow because his units were a bit fragmented checking all over the map, maybe a bit lacking of storm, the attack kills his 4th, and then dark swarm is up so soulkey gets the 5th`

`note: snow builds a couple of DTs to help both with tthe defense but also as a surprise to kill drones at new bases and ends up killing like 12 drones. it honestly saved him in this scenario`

`note: from here they just eye for eye back and fourth until snow finally takes control again and finishes up the game. it was just dark swarm + lurker + hydra vs gateway man storm with some sneak DTs back and fourth really nail biting`
