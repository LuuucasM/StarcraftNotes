Map: [[Dominator]]

Snow BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]
Soulkey BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]

### Game Build and Notes
- after the 5th probe mines one mineral patch send it across the map
- 8 - 0:49 - pylon (in the center)
- 9 - 1:14 - gate 1
- 9 - 1:28 - gate 2
- @100% gate 1  (and then 2) full pump zealots
- 15 - 2:16 - pylon
- 22 - 2:50 - pylon
- 29 - 3:35 - pylon

`note: it looks like the whole goal of snow with this rush is to kill the natural hatch. he isnt splitting off any zealots or anything he is keeping them all together and making sure he is engaging with a full straight line of zealots and performing moving shots. he is pulling back the low health ones when needed. soulkey brings some drones to build a spine and mineral walk to glitch out the zealots a bit. Just keep in mind snow is never greeding for the hatch, i think he could have and killed it but my guess is if he does and doesnt kill the zerglings then he will die to a simple counter attack? im not sure but hes hesitant to `

- 4:30 - gate (in main)

`note at this point soulkey got a spine up and snow has to transition and this prompted snow to build a gate in his main`

- 5:22 - pylon at natrual
- 6:14 - forge at nat

`note snow is doing a lot of dancing with soulkey because soulkey hasnt built any drones still so snow is constantly having to shift where is zealots are between defending the middle gates and defending his main`

`note: soulkey finishs speed now and so snow is forced to cannon in his main and bascially bring all his zealots back. before speed the zealots could sort of mirror how the zergligns move but now with speed its just impossible so hes just bringing all the zealots back `

- 7:45 - assimilator
- 8:00 - forge in main (cuz it was killed in nat by speedlings)
- 8:30 - 2 cannons at natural 

`note its about now when soulkey starts getting rid of the center gates cuz snow cant defend both his base and the gate as said earlier`

# I MADE IT TO 9:30 KEEP GOING FOR THE REST OF THE GAME
