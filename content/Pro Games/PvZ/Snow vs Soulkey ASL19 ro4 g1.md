Map: [[Metropolis]]

Snow BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]
Soulkey BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]

### Game Build and Notes
- 8 - 0:48 - pylon
- 12 - 1:38 - forge

`note: snow scouts with pylon probe and gets a first scout off and sees soulkey has a 1:14 pool which is overlord then pool which will help determine his forge timing`

`note: soulkey sends out his drone very early but he doesnt have minerals until about 2:03 but he wanted the option to either just take the 3rd instead of if the probe goes away  he can take the second`

- 13 - 2:08 - nexus
- 13 - 2:19 - cannon
- 15 - 2:44 - gate

`note: with snows scouting probe he saw soulkey made 6 zerglings which is enough to be able to do a runby and try and kill the cannon so snow brings a couple of extra probes to make the wall`

- 16 - 2:53 - pylon
- 17 - 3:06 - gas
- @100% gate -> make zeelots
- 24 - 3:50 - cyber

`note: usually u want to start cyber as you are putting probes on ur first gas cuz it works out that u will have 150 gas for the starport when the cyber finishes`

- 30 - 4:13 - pylon
- 34 - 4:32 - stargate
- ~40 - 4:50 - pylon
`note: snow moves out with this 2 zealots, not sure how he made this decision because he didnt even keep his scouting probe alive. i suppose it provides scouting for him to see if hes getting hydra rushed. the zealots arrive at the base around 4:50. also snow is rallying his gateway to the other side of the map. he gets the zealots into the main behind the mineral line which lets him rally a zealot into the nat and the 3rd.`

`note: behind this snow does build a cannon a when the zealot thing starts running out of gas but i think its better to build the cannon a bit earlier if possible in case of a counter attack if the opponent just floods lings`

- 5:46 - zealot leg house

`note: unfortuantely snow didnt block the front and the speedlings ran in and killed a cannon and gets 4 lings into the main base which is super annoying`

`note: unforunately because of the cannon kill + distracting the zealots with the lings in the main, soulkey brings more lings and now mutas to the front and kills the newly built cannon, and the mineral line cannon isnt ready yet. this happens at about 6:50. from here snow just cant stabalize. snow only has 1-2 cosairs and there are scourge and mutas and theres just enough mutas to shoot down everything, honestly even the corsairs he could kill lol`
# I MADE IT TO 4:12 NEED TO FINISH THE REST OF THIS GAME
