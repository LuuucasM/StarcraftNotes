Map: [[Eclipse]]

Snow BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]
Soulkey BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]

### Game Build and Notes
- 8 - 0:49 - pylon
- 11 - 1:26 - forge

`note: sends out the probe after forge to scout`

`note: he scouts that it is hatch first which lets him take a nexus first and non-stop probe production`

- 14 - 2:10 - nexus
- 15 - 2:27 - pylon
- 16 - 2:40 - gate
- 17 - 2:53 - assimilator 1
- 17 - 3:03 - cannon
- @100% gate - 3:28 -> cyber -> zealot
- 25 - 3:59 - assimilator
- 27 - 4:11 - stargate
- 33 - 4:27 - pylon
- 4:37 - start +1 ground weapons
- 4:47 - start +1 air weapons
- @100% stargate -> pump corsairs

`note: snow goes up to 5 corsairs and then stops`

- 40 - 5:05 - pylon
- 42 - 5:12 - second cannon at nat

`note: not really sure why he got the second cannon but he does this quite consistantly. Part of me wants to believe its because he no longer has scouting information from his probe and is playing just blind so he builds the cannon just in case some hydra stuff is happening`

- 48 - 5:40 - pylon
- 6:02 - zealot leg house
- 6:16 - cannon in his main to cover stargate + mineral line
- 6:40 - gate 2
- @100% zealot leg house - 6:44 -> templar house -> zealot legs
- 7:04 - gate 3
- 7:16 - gate 4

`note: at about ~7:10 snow is able to sneak out a zealot by pretending to push out the lings but actually sending one of the zealots to the side. then with that zealot he full sends across the map and is able to scout that soulkey is actually building a big hydra ball (which soulkey just started doing so im not sure if this is deliberate timing from snow) which lets snow start preparing 7 cannons at home for`

- @100% templar house -> 1 DT -> storm -> 2 HT

`note: soulkey goes in for an attack snow has 6 zealots, 5 corsairs and 6 cannons at the beginning of the attack. after all is said he lost a couple of cannons and all the zealots but he kept most of the corsairs and sniped multiple overlords as the hydras were trying to bust in. Snow holds the first wave but theres a second one coming and its killing the forge + gate at the front so snow builds another forge. It is important to kill the overlords so when the DT comes out if theres no detection the attack is over. snow ends up having to pull some probes to the front to cover the cannons because he lost his wall and only has a couple of HT. also now hes going up to 8 cannons. at the last second snows storm finishes and he is able to storm the hydras twice which lets him sortof stabalize. he turns the 2 HT into archons and gets himself back up to 7 cannons`

- 9:44 - gate 4, 5, 6 `(note: because gate 1 died in the hydra attack hes building gate 4 again)`
- 10:14 - gate 7, 8, 9
- 10:29 - robo facility

`note: since snow has fully held it looks like hes totally powering up his inferstructure right now. robo + goon range + +2 ground weapons..., etc`

`note: at ~11:00 he is running around with his corsairs trying to see if he can see anything. soulkey right now is going into muta scourge, and it looks like snow knows this is a possibility because he is flying like hes a bit scared. then at 11:20 he flys over the 3rd base and sees only drones, hatches, and gas being mined and he immediately turns around. I am curious if because he sees no hydras or sunks or anything like you would normally see if the zerg decided to just hunker down and drone up that he knows at least that soulkey is still building units and because he doesnt see any hydras those units could likely be muta scourge? and infact in response he sends 4 zealots to the 3rd just to see if he can do something. He ends up spotting the mutas with his retreating corsairs. also in response to the mutas he does put a second cannon in his main`

- @100% robo facility -> observer house

`note: once snow has got all his tech laid out and 6 HT he starts going goon. this starts at around ~12. Also just note at this time hes at about ~130 supply`

- 12:55 - 3rd base

`note: he is taking this base as hes running out onto the map with his army of like a couple control groups of units + 6 HT and corsairs`

`note: at this point with this push in soulkey is just so far behind he doesnt really have enough to defend. The mutas get an HT or 2 but all die, and then after that there is still 4 HT + almost a protoss unit for every zerg unit so snow just runs him over`
