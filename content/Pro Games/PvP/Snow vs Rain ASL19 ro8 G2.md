### Game Build and Notes
- 8 - 00:50 - pylon
- 10 - 1:13 - gate
- 11 - 1:30 - gas

`note: scout after gas`

- 13 - 1:55 - cyber
- 16 - 2:17 - pylon
- @2:32 - zealot pops out
- @100% cyber - goon

`note: snow does not stop making probes at 150 gas instead he just goes over gas a bit`

- @3:10 - goon pops out
- 24 - 3:17 - pylon
- 26 - 3:44 - robo
- 29 - 4:06 - pylon
- @100% robo - observatory
- @100% observatory - observer + robo bay

`note: Obs takes 25 seconds and robo bay takes 30 seconds to build so if you start them at about the same time they will finish together`

- 38 - 5:06 - pylon
- @100% robo bay, reaver
- 47 - 5:45 - pylon
- 48 - 5:58 - nexus
- @100% reaver - reaver
- 6:30 - pylon
- 6:40 - gateway up to 2 gates
- @100% reaver - shuttle

`note: at this point he takes a fight of 9 rain goons vs 7 his goons up high ground but snow wasnt targeting at first and ended up losing 6 rain goons to 4 snow goons. This is bad for snow because he is already behind on production because he got his expo later so even though he traded it was less than ideal`

- ~8:00 - 4 more gates up to 6 gates

`Snow does a weird like base trade thingy which started off as a good idea cuz rains units were out and snow just finished shuttle speed so he can get harass done but snow didnt have nearly enough at home and rains straight up attack out did the probes and whatever else snow got with his little attack`
