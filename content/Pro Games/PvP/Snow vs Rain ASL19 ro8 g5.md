### Game Build and Notes
- 8 - 0:48 - pylon
- 10 - 1:15 - gate
- 11 - 1:34 - gas
- 13 - 1:55 - cyber
- 16 - 2:15 - pylon
- @100% cyber -> goon -> on 21 get range
- 22 - 3:08 - gate 2
- 24 - 3:16 - pylon
- 29 - 4:02 - robo
- 29 - 4:10 - pylon

`note: at 4:55 snow did an attack with 1 zealot and 4 goons vs rains just 3 goons up the ramp to his main but snow didnt do very well with it as a 4th and 5th goon just popped so snow ended up losing 2 goons and the zealot for 1 goon. unfortuantely rain also has 2gate robo like snow but snow is just down units now so hes a bit behind`

- 5:07 - obs house

`note snow does another little poke in and sees that rain has an observer so he can plan his next move`

- 5:42 - reaver house

`note: after some back and forth of dancing goons and obs, snow gets to see that rain isnt expanding yet but instead he sees a shuttl (likely with a reaver) heading his way`

- 8:18 - nat expand
- 8:55 - gates 3 and 4
- 11:20 - gates 5 and 6

`note: snow did a little weird jig with his army and was going to counter attack but didnt counter attack and then rain just went straight forward and then snow the decided to come back so snow ended up about a full macro sycle of goons down from rain and  in the end rain just overpowered with goons. rain didnt even try to take a 3rd lol just big overpower`
