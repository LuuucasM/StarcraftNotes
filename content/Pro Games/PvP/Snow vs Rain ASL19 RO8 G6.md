Map: [[Dominator]]

Snow BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]
Rain BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]

### Game Build and Notes
- after new (5th) probe returns 1 mineral payload send it out to the middle of the map
- 8 - 0:49 - pylon
- 9 - 1:13 - gate
- 9 - 1:28 - gate 2
- @100% gates -> pump zealots
- 15 - 2:18 - pylon

`note: at 2:45 snow gets into rains base with his probe and he starts building pylons around the gateway to trap the incoming dragoon but rain puts down a shield battery to block it`

`note: when snows pylon finishes he builds 2 sheield batteries to the right of the gateway to try and block the goon again. when the goon finishes tho the arrea was blocked by zealots and it spawned on top of the gateway.`

`then he chases 1 goon with 1 zealot and then fights the probe/zealot with the other 2, and also getting ready to block the next dragoon. It again pops on the top cuz the zealot blocked it from spawning inside but snow was ready for this`

`it looks like rain eventually stablaizes somehow but hes only got about 8-9 probes but he does have dragoons and snow doesnt have any tech yet still just 2 gates`

- 5:35 - forge (because it looks like rain is going to be able to stabilize)
- 5:40 - gas in main 

`snow wants to try to lock rain in his base using high ground cannons but rain has enough to shoot it out so snow builds a pylon at the front of his ramp in his main and a cannon to stop rains stuff from just walking up and killing him. also snow is preparing a counter attack with the units still building from his center gate`

`snow does the counter attack and it does some delaying but rain had some pretty good micro and everything ended up ok. now both of them are going into 3gate follow up`

- 7:45 - cyber

`note: at this point they are both going 3 gate but snow lost a couple units while doing the jig with rain so he went goons down and then couldnt hold the pylon for his center gate`

 - 11:00 - robo

`im not sure if its just he had extra resources or if he meant to go or if he knew his 3gate was behind rains at this point but he did put down the robo idk`

`rain just ran down the ramp and there was 9 goons and a cannon vs 12 goons but then a shuttle popped out just in time and snow could micro dodge goon shots. also cannons r kinda crazy. also rain had to run down the ramp first before he could start shooting so even tho he had the numbers, it wasnt enough numbers considering those factors`
