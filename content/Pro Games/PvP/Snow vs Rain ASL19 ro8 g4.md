![[Goon Defense.png]]

`note: in the above picture when rain looks to be getting a bit aggressive snow pulls back to his nexus like this. I beleive that since snow doesnt have a more forward pylon to take goon shots hes planning on using the nexus as a damage battery if rain were to dry and move in`

- 56 - 6:44 - gate 2
- 7:05 - shuttle speed

`note snow scouts that rain is doing a very similar build and puts down a battery in his nat for some reason even tho they both have reaver dragoon. maybe it is because rain has the second gateway faster and has the slight supply lead? Also notice snow is very active in checking the different paths rain can come by ground maybe trying to catch a move out by rain`

- 73 - 7:44 - gate 3, 4

`note: snows robo build order was obs -> revaer -> suttle -> reaver. I believe that when snow feels like hes going to get attacked he instead goes second reaver before shuttle but in this case since he scouted they were doing similar things its better to go shuttle cuz reaver + shuttle > reaver + reaver`

- 9:30 - gate 5, 6 `note: I think you can get these gates a bit earlier maybe aroun 9:00 or late 8min but snow was very busy microing. Rain got his around late 8min `

`note: at this at about the ~10min mark both have 6 gates and robo constantly producing goon reaver shuttle (and obs if needed). They will just sit on this for a while until probably the game ends. i am not sure how you determine if you should switch to templar in pvp`

- 10:30 3rd expansion

`note: so snow ended up getting a 3rd reaver and second shuttle and used it to go kill probes in rains base and then while rain was looking at the reaver drop snow made a move out in the front and killed the reavers there so snow killed a bunch of probes like 15-20 + won the battle out infront of his base. this basically secured the game`
