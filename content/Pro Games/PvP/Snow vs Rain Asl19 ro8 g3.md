Rain BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]

### Game Build and Notes
- 8 -  00:47 - pylon
- 10 - 1:16 - gate
- 12 - 1:34 - gas

`note: once rain comes into snows base with his probe hes oddly aggressive and snow starts fighting back quite a bitbut doesnt fully chance the probe `

- 13 - 1:58 - cyber
- 14 - 2:06 - zealot
- 16 - 2:13 - pylon

`note: rain does eventually end up getting the manner pylon down`

- @100% cyber -> goon

`note: rain puts down a pylon to the left next to snows gateway. this is to trap in the goon. Snows response is to build a shield battery to the right of the pylon so that rain cant block it.`

`note: at this point snow also sees the first zealot walk into his base so rain has 1 zealot and 2 probes. Snow pulls 6 probes and surrounds his zealot and tries to posture up. Also notice that he took 2 probes off gas which makes sense because usually in this situation you are not using gas so its ok if theres only 1 guy on it`

`note: At this point rain cancels the first pylon and builds a second one hoping to trap the goon in a different way but the space is actually enough for a goon and snow knows this so continues to produce the battery snow also makes sure to position his zealot and probes around the spot that rain wants to build so he cant which allows snows goon to come out`

`note: now that snows goon is out and the battery is finish he starts taking a fight witht he 6 probes 1 zealot 1 goon vs 3 zealots and 2 probes he gets some good damage on a couple of the zealots while microing his probes back so that they dont die. this prompts rain to run away with the 2 zealots while he brings in 2 more but then snow just focuses on protecting his mineral line from the 2 new zealots by having his goon + mineral line go after the 2 new zealots, and the probes + zealot go after the damaged zealots and probes of rain. Snow does lose a few probes but does some good mineral walking and probe pulling back`

`note: now snow has 2 dragoons and he seems to be doing quite well as the original dealots are dead he just has to deal with the incoming ones. at this point snow still does pull more probes again he has 5 probes with him now even tho he has 2 goons, a zealot, and a battery. he ends up losing 3 more probes but with the battery there he is able to clean it up quite well and thats gg`
