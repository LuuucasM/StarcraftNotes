My BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]
Opponents BO: [[BUILD ORDER TODO]]
### Opponent General BO
- 9 - 1:04 - pool
- 9 - 1:20 - extractor trick
- 10 - 1:17 - overlord
- @100% pool - 6 lings and continuously make lings until you think they have held
- 12 - 2:12 - nat hatch
### What I did good
- Build was tight at the beginning
### What I Need to improve
- I need to pull 4-5 probes right away when I see fast lings. 
- His 6 lings arrive at my nat as my second zealot spawns so if this happens i just need to pull 4-5 probes asap
